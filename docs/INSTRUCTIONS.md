# Instructions
For any macros without specfic instructions, assume the General instructions apply.

### General
1. Ensure that the game is not about to enter a new day/night cycle.
2. Unplug/disconnect all other controllers/attach Joy-Cons to console.
3. Plug in Arduino.
    - If not using a button matrix, the Arduino should already start activating the macro for the set [Zone ID](https://github.com/zsd7200/plza-shiny-tool/blob/master/docs/ZONE_ID.md).
    - If using button matrix, push appropriate button.

**Note:** You may need to unplug/replug the Arduino in or press the Reset button to select a new macro.

### Refresh Area
1. Fly to any Fly Zone.
2. Unplug/disconnect all other controllers/attach Joy-Cons to console.
3. Plug in Arduino.
4. If using button matrix, push appropriate button.

### Refresh Bench
1. Go to any bench.
2. Use bench once to ensure the camera and player character are at the correct locations for the macro.
3. Unplug/disconnect all other controllers/attach Joy-Cons to console.
4. Plug in Arduino.
5. If using button matrix, push appropriate button.

### Trade Macro
1. Open up a local or online trade with another console actively using the macro.
   - You will need to be on the Pokémon select screen.
2. Unplug/disconnect all other controllers/attach Joy-Cons to console.
3. Plug in Arduino or push appropriate button on button matrix at the same time on both consoles.
4. If done correctly, trades should begin and the macro should disconnect the trade session upon completion.

**Note**: Any trade macro above the "Trade 1 Pokémon" macro assumes you are at the top-left (or at least the leftmost) space in any given box (not counting party Pokémon).
